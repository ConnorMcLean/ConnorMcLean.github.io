    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ConnorMcLean/POS-API">POS-API</a></h3>
    <p>
      POS-style RESTful API, written in Java with a PostgreSQL database using the
      Spring and Hibernate frameworks. Tracks customers, orders and current products,
      with capability to add more, will eventually fill and return PDF templates
      relating to said data through the PDFbox library.
      Authentication and the front-end components are currently under progress.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ConnorMcLean/MEAN-WebApp">Issue tracking app</a></h3>
    <p>
      Basic MEAN stack application created using Angular 6 and a RESTful API with
      form submission and mongoose data modelling. Completed by following an online guide.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ConnorMcLean/AutoOrderComparison"> Auto Order Comparison</a></h3>
    <p>
      Basic python scripting to compare two csv files via a master reference sheet and list
      all discrepencies found between files for later review. Compared both expected cost
      and amount of parts between an order file and a receipt file.
      Completed using the Pandas dataframe library.
      Files were too inconsistent from suppliers to fully complete the project.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/ConnorMcLean/UnDelay-PTV-Delay-Finder">UnDelay</a></h3>
    <p>
      A MEAN stack application created to track live delays in the public transport network.
      This was done via the PTV API and Live data submission.
      Created during the Web Information Techonologies subject in 2017 at the University of Melbourne.
